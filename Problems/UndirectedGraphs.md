Directed Graphs Problems
----
<p>
#### Question 1. Nonrecursive depth-first search. 
<p>
Implement depth-first search in an undirected graph without using recursion.

#### Question 2. Diameter and center of a tree. 
<p>
Given a connected graph with no cycles
* Diameter: design a linear-time algorithm to find the longest simple path in the graph.

* Center: design a linear-time algorithm to find a vertex such that its maximum distance from any other vertex is minimized.


#### Question 3. Eulierian cycle. 
<p>
An Eulierian cycle in a graph is a cycle (not necessarily simple) that uses every edge in the graph exactly one.

* Show that a graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex has even degree and all of the vertices with nonzero degree belong to the same connected component.

* Design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether a graph has an Eulerian cycle, and if so, find one.
